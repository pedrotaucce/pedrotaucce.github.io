abstract={We studied the floral biology and performed experimental intra- and interspecific pollinations in populations of a complex of four <em>Acianthera</em> (Orchidaceae) species occurring in Brazilian campo rupestre vegetation (<em>A. hamosa</em>, <em>. limae</em>, <em>A. modestissima</em>, and <em>A. prolifera</em>). All four species flower synchronously, are partially intercompatible, and exhibited some degree of self-sterility. Floral morphology is similar in all the species, with their principal differences associated with size of the floral structures. The four species were visited only by Diptera species of the families Phoridae (<em>Megaselia</em> spp.) and Chloropidae, but visits are rare and fruit set is very low. Sympatric species were not pollinated by the same Diptera species. <em>Acianthera hamosa</em> and <em>A. modestissima</em> have the smallest flowers, and no marked morphological differences between them were observed; they were both pollinated by very similar Megaselia species. Both prepollination barriers and postpollination events are important to maintaining the isolation of the species, functioning as overlapping filters that diminish the possibility of gene flow between them. However, putative hybrids between <em>A. prolifera</em> and <em>A. limae</em> have been found. Conversely, <em>A. hamosa</em> and <em>A. modestissima</em>, which are recognized only by vegetative characters that show high phenotypic plasticity, seem only to be isolated by geographical barriers, and they may actually constitute a single species or be sister species.},

Its closest related species is <em>I. nasuta</em> according to the original description. We describe the advertisement call of <em>I. izecksohni</em> based on specimens recorded and collected at the municipality of Nova Lima, state of Minas Gerais, distant about 10 km straight line from its type locality. The advertisement call consists of a group of notes emitted sporadically without a regular interval between the calls. Call duration (n = 36 calls in four individuals) ranged from 1.03 to 1.85 s (= 1.52 ± 0.21 s) and the call rise time from 0.66 to 1.52 s (= 1.16 ± 0.25 s), with 34-57 notes per call (= 47.42 ± 6.03). Peak frequency ranged from 2250 to 2625 Hz, the dominant frequency from 1317.8 to 3128.0 Hz and interval between notes from 22.00 to 41.00 ms (= 28.63 ± 0.03 ms). From the examination of herpetological collections, morphological and bioacoustical data we extended the species known distribution ca. 200 km eastward, to ten new localities, all of them outside the Quadril{\'a}tero Ferr{\'i}fero region, at the Mantiqueira mountain range. We analyzed color patterns and we find some dorsal patterns not described at the original description of <em>I. izecksohni</em>. We also make some comments concerning the taxonomic status of <em>I. izecksohni</em> and <em>I. nasuta</em>.},

Although these studies are paramount for understanding species diversity, few of them actually formalize species delimitations to the final step of nomenclatural acts. Historically, the Neotropical frog genus <em>Adenomera</em> has been considered as a difficult taxonomic group because it comprises many morphologically similar species exhibiting high levels of intraspecific polymorphism. A recent work using molecular data shed light on the phylogenetic relationships within the genus and identified several lineages that may correspond to undescribed species but did not delimit species boundaries. In the Atlantic Forest, a clade formed by <em>A. marmorata</em> and two putative species (<em>Adenomera</em> sp. J and <em>Adenomera</em> sp. K) were identified. In this paper, we combine morphological, acoustic, and molecular data in order to evaluate species limits within this Atlantic Forest <em>Adenomera</em> clade. We provide a redescription of <em>A. marmorata</em> and restrict its type locality to the Tijuca Massif, in the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Our results do not support <em>A. marmorata</em> and the two candidate species as diagnosable distinct species. Therefore <em>A. marmorata</em> corresponds to a species with pronounced morphological and acoustic variation in the genus and a complex phylogeographic structure.},

Here we provide detailed data on the embryonic ontogeny of <em>Ischnocnema henselii</em>, and compare some morphological aspects related to its developmental mode within and outside of the brachycephaloid clade. Embryonic development in <em>I. henselii</em> is characterized by a unicuspid egg tooth (bicuspid in most other Brachycephaloidea), external gills present, open vent tube, and tail fins with dorsoventral orientation throughout the development. We also provide the first account of skin development in direct-developing frogs, revealing that the maturation of the integument has a typical dorsal to ventral sequence of changes as in most biphasic anurans. The early onset of thyroid development seems to be consistent with the hypothesis that the evolution of direct development in anuran amphibians involved precocious activation of the thyroid axis. A comparative analysis with the still few described embryonic ontogenies for direct-developing species reveals variation in the length of the embryonic period, rate of development, size at hatching and presence/absence of external morphological characters, which suggests heterochronic shifts in the rate of species-specific stage progression. All these details reinforce the idea of the high morphological variability among direct-developing frogs.},

	abstract = {Direct development implies transformations with respect to the anuran biphasic life cycle, including changes in embryonic anatomy. In the clade Brachycephaloidea, skeletal ontogeny is known in <em>Eleutherodactylus coqui</em> of the basal family <em>Eleutherodactylidae</em>. In this work, we study it in four species representing the two other families in the group. We worked with developmental series of <em>Oreobates barituensis</em>, <em>Haddadus binotatus</em>, <em>Ischnocnema henselii</em>, and <em>Brachycephalus ephippium</em>. Specimens were prepared following protocols of clearing and staining and histology. In the cranium, results show an overall shared pattern that, as summarized for <em>E. coqui</em>, combines a partial recapitulation of aspects of the ancestral biphasic ontogeny with a profound remodeling that includes lost/novel structures and heterochronic shifts of developmental events. Among these transformations are the absence of suprarostrals and trabecular horns and the precocious ossification of jaw and suspensorium. In addition, each lineage shows particular features such that skull ontogeny varies interspecifically. In turn, the morphogenesis of the axial and appendicular skeleton is highly conserved, with main variations including the extent of ossification at hatching. Along with some external features such as the egg tooth and the enveloping tail with transversely arranged fins, an ossification sequence with extremely accelerated ossification of jaws and suspensorium could be distinctive of Brachycephaloidea.},

abstract = {<em>“Eleutherodactylus” bilineatus</em> has long been an enigma. Recent phylogenetic analyses have recovered this species as part of a clade including <em>Barycholos</em> and <em>Noblella</em>, but the relationship among these groups still remains contentious. In this study, we test the phylogenetic position and reassess the taxonomic status of this long-term incertae sedis species. We use phylogenetic analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial gene sequences and data for external morphology and osteology of <em>“E.” bilineatus</em> and its related genera. We recover the species as an independent lineage forming a fully supported clade with <em>Barycholos</em> and <em>Noblella</em>. The combination of inferred relationships and morphological traits supports the erection of a new genus that we name and diagnose. Our analyses also recover a non-monophyletic Noblella and the species of the genus, although morphologically similar, are part of different clades: one including species from central Andes and the other one including species from northern Andes. Moreover, distribution patterns point out connections among distant biogeographical areas of South America and a widespread distribution of an ancestor for the clade including <em>Barycholos</em>, <em>“E.” bilineatus</em>, and <em>Noblella</em>. We also compare the relationships among clades of Brachycephaloidea and, hence, the family and subfamily classifications in different studies. We show that the family classification is probably far from becoming stable, mostly due to arbitrary selections of hierarchy of the clades. However, we show that by assigning a family to each of the highly supported and frequently recovered clades would render a more stable taxonomy of Brachycephaloidea.},

Here, we describe draft de novo genome, mitogenome, and transcriptome assemblies for the Neotropical leaf-frog <em>Phyllomedusa bahiana</em> native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and Caatinga. We used a combination of PacBio long reads and Illumina sequencing to produce a 4.74-Gbp contig-level genome assembly, which has a contiguity comparable to other recent nonchromosome level assemblies. The assembled mitogenome comprises 16,239 bp and the gene content and arrangement are similar to other Neobratrachia. RNA-sequencing from 8 tissues resulted in a highly complete (86.3\%) reference transcriptome. We further use whole-genome resequencing data from <em>P. bahiana</em> and from its sister species <em>Phyllomedusa burmeisteri</em>, to demonstrate how our assembly can be used as a backbone for population genomics studies within the <em>P. burmeisteri</em> species group. Our assemblies thus represent important additions to the catalog of genomic resources available from amphibians.}",

   abstract={We herein present the first annotated anuran checklist for the Brazilian state of Amapá, eastern Amazonia, based on a thorough literature review. We recorded the occurrence of 111 species belonging to 13 anuran families distributed across 48 localities throughout Amapá, within two biomes. Among these species, 62.5% occur exclusively in the Tropical Moist Broadleaf Forest biome, ~8% occur exclusively in the Tropical Savanna biome, and ~29% occur in both. Two species were considered endemic to Amapá and were registered only in the central portion of the state. Regarding the conservation status, only one species (<em>Dendropsophus amicorum</em>) is classified as threatened, assigned to the “critically endangered” category. The other species are categorized as either “least concern” or “data deficient” (85 and 8, respectively), whereas 21 are not evaluated. The current annotated list contributes to the incipient knowledge on anuran species richness in Amapá and, despite the research regarding anuran taxonomy has considerably progressed over the past 20 years, there is still much to do. Our data highlight the need for trained taxonomists to develop research in the state.},

abstract = {Despite the huge difference in land coverage between mountains and lowlands, most species are indeed found in mountains and foothills. The causes of this pattern have challenged biogeographers and evolutionary biologists. The Espinhaço and Mantiqueira Ranges are large mountain ranges from eastern Brazil that are global biodiversity hotspots located between the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF) and the Cerrado. However, Espinhaço and Mantiqueira species diversity may still be underestimated, either due to taxonomic complexity or morphological cryptic species complexes. Two hylid frogs, <em>Bokermannohyla nanuzae</em> and <em>Bokermannohyla feioi</em>, are endemic, respectively, distributed in these two mountain ranges. These species were recently synonymized based on traditional taxonomy. We used data from the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene 16S and two nuclear genes to undertake phylogenetic and network, distance-based, and multispecies coalescent analyses on <em>B. nanuzae</em>, <em>B. feioi</em>, and an extensive outgroup dataset. We tested the monophyly of <em>B. nanuzae</em>, as well as the presence of candidate new species. Based on 16S phylogenetic analysis, we recovered <em>B. nanuzae</em> as paraphyletic, with <em>B. sagarana</em> nested within it. We recovered two main groups, with the geographic distribution generally corresponding to the Cerrado and AF boundaries. Probably due to ancestral polymorphism, both nuclear haplotype genealogies failed to distinguish <em>B. nanuzae</em> from the former <em>B. feioi</em> and/or from <em>B. sagarana</em>. The time-calibrated mtDNA tree revealed that <em>B. martinsi</em>, <em>B. sagarana</em>, and <em>B. nanuzae</em> have diverged during the Late Miocene, subsequently splitting into the remaining species/lineages during the Plio-Pleistocene. Taken together, our distance-based barcode and nuclear Bayesian analyses identified the former <em>B. feioi</em>, referred to as the AF group, as a distinct evolutionary lineage from <em>B. nanuzae</em> (Cerrado group). We provide the first insights into how different evolutionary lineages speciated in the highlands of southeastern Brazil and revalidated <em>B. feioi</em> for the AF group.},

abstract = {The Atlantic Forest is recognized as a biodiversity hotspot because of the high species richness and the remaining natural areascomprising less than 30% relative to its primary vegetation. Even though many anuran species from this biome are ecologically restricted to pristine ecosystems, there are some examples of new species discovered from anthropized areas. <em>Adenomera</em> represents a widespread and abundant frog genus in Atlantic Forest ecosystems, with species occurring in areas with varying degrees of human disturbance. In this paper, we name and describe a new species of <em>Adenomera</em> endemic to the Atlantic Forest typically found in human-altered ecosystems, such as urba and rural sites. The new species was recovered as belonging to the <em>Adenomera marmorata</em> clade, and sister to <em>A. ajurauna</em>. These two species have allopatric distributions in southeastern and southern Brazil, with a single known sympatric occurrence. They display different calls and occupy distinct habitats. The newly described species of <em>Adenomera</em> is an additional case of new species discovered from urban sites in the Atlantic Forest hotspot.},
