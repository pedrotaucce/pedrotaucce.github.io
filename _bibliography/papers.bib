abstract={We studied the floral biology and performed experimental intra- and interspecific pollinations in populations of a complex of four <em>Acianthera</em> (Orchidaceae) species occurring in Brazilian campo rupestre vegetation (<em>A. hamosa</em>, <em>. limae</em>, <em>A. modestissima</em>, and <em>A. prolifera</em>). All four species flower synchronously, are partially intercompatible, and exhibited some degree of self-sterility. Floral morphology is similar in all the species, with their principal differences associated with size of the floral structures. The four species were visited only by Diptera species of the families Phoridae (<em>Megaselia</em> spp.) and Chloropidae, but visits are rare and fruit set is very low. Sympatric species were not pollinated by the same Diptera species. <em>Acianthera hamosa</em> and <em>A. modestissima</em> have the smallest flowers, and no marked morphological differences between them were observed; they were both pollinated by very similar Megaselia species. Both prepollination barriers and postpollination events are important to maintaining the isolation of the species, functioning as overlapping filters that diminish the possibility of gene flow between them. However, putative hybrids between <em>A. prolifera</em> and <em>A. limae</em> have been found. Conversely, <em>A. hamosa</em> and <em>A. modestissima</em>, which are recognized only by vegetative characters that show high phenotypic plasticity, seem only to be isolated by geographical barriers, and they may actually constitute a single species or be sister species.},

Its closest related species is <em>I. nasuta</em> according to the original description. We describe the advertisement call of <em>I. izecksohni</em> based on specimens recorded and collected at the municipality of Nova Lima, state of Minas Gerais, distant about 10 km straight line from its type locality. The advertisement call consists of a group of notes emitted sporadically without a regular interval between the calls. Call duration (n = 36 calls in four individuals) ranged from 1.03 to 1.85 s (= 1.52 ± 0.21 s) and the call rise time from 0.66 to 1.52 s (= 1.16 ± 0.25 s), with 34-57 notes per call (= 47.42 ± 6.03). Peak frequency ranged from 2250 to 2625 Hz, the dominant frequency from 1317.8 to 3128.0 Hz and interval between notes from 22.00 to 41.00 ms (= 28.63 ± 0.03 ms). From the examination of herpetological collections, morphological and bioacoustical data we extended the species known distribution ca. 200 km eastward, to ten new localities, all of them outside the Quadril{\'a}tero Ferr{\'i}fero region, at the Mantiqueira mountain range. We analyzed color patterns and we find some dorsal patterns not described at the original description of <em>I. izecksohni</em>. We also make some comments concerning the taxonomic status of <em>I. izecksohni</em> and <em>I. nasuta</em>.},

Although these studies are paramount for understanding species diversity, few of them actually formalize species delimitations to the final step of nomenclatural acts. Historically, the Neotropical frog genus <em>Adenomera</em> has been considered as a difficult taxonomic group because it comprises many morphologically similar species exhibiting high levels of intraspecific polymorphism. A recent work using molecular data shed light on the phylogenetic relationships within the genus and identified several lineages that may correspond to undescribed species but did not delimit species boundaries. In the Atlantic Forest, a clade formed by <em>A. marmorata</em> and two putative species (<em>Adenomera</em> sp. J and <em>Adenomera</em> sp. K) were identified. In this paper, we combine morphological, acoustic, and molecular data in order to evaluate species limits within this Atlantic Forest <em>Adenomera</em> clade. We provide a redescription of <em>A. marmorata</em> and restrict its type locality to the Tijuca Massif, in the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Our results do not support <em>A. marmorata</em> and the two candidate species as diagnosable distinct species. Therefore <em>A. marmorata</em> corresponds to a species with pronounced morphological and acoustic variation in the genus and a complex phylogeographic structure.},

Here we provide detailed data on the embryonic ontogeny of <em>Ischnocnema henselii</em>, and compare some morphological aspects related to its developmental mode within and outside of the brachycephaloid clade. Embryonic development in <em>I. henselii</em> is characterized by a unicuspid egg tooth (bicuspid in most other Brachycephaloidea), external gills present, open vent tube, and tail fins with dorsoventral orientation throughout the development. We also provide the first account of skin development in direct-developing frogs, revealing that the maturation of the integument has a typical dorsal to ventral sequence of changes as in most biphasic anurans. The early onset of thyroid development seems to be consistent with the hypothesis that the evolution of direct development in anuran amphibians involved precocious activation of the thyroid axis. A comparative analysis with the still few described embryonic ontogenies for direct-developing species reveals variation in the length of the embryonic period, rate of development, size at hatching and presence/absence of external morphological characters, which suggests heterochronic shifts in the rate of species-specific stage progression. All these details reinforce the idea of the high morphological variability among direct-developing frogs.},

	abstract = {Direct development implies transformations with respect to the anuran biphasic life cycle, including changes in embryonic anatomy. In the clade Brachycephaloidea, skeletal ontogeny is known in <em>Eleutherodactylus coqui</em> of the basal family <em>Eleutherodactylidae</em>. In this work, we study it in four species representing the two other families in the group. We worked with developmental series of <em>Oreobates barituensis</em>, <em>Haddadus binotatus</em>, <em>Ischnocnema henselii</em>, and <em>Brachycephalus ephippium</em>. Specimens were prepared following protocols of clearing and staining and histology. In the cranium, results show an overall shared pattern that, as summarized for <em>E. coqui</em>, combines a partial recapitulation of aspects of the ancestral biphasic ontogeny with a profound remodeling that includes lost/novel structures and heterochronic shifts of developmental events. Among these transformations are the absence of suprarostrals and trabecular horns and the precocious ossification of jaw and suspensorium. In addition, each lineage shows particular features such that skull ontogeny varies interspecifically. In turn, the morphogenesis of the axial and appendicular skeleton is highly conserved, with main variations including the extent of ossification at hatching. Along with some external features such as the egg tooth and the enveloping tail with transversely arranged fins, an ossification sequence with extremely accelerated ossification of jaws and suspensorium could be distinctive of Brachycephaloidea.},
