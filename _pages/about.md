Welcome to the Laboratory of Evolutionary Biology and Systematics of Current Tetrapods! We are part of the Department of Biological Sciences at São Paulo State University (Unesp), Bauru, Brazil. Our research focuses on gathering diverse lines of evidence to explore the evolutionary biology and systematics of tetrapods, with a special emphasis on amphibians and reptiles.
