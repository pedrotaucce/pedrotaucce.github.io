Welcome to the Laboratory of Evolutionary Biology and Systematics of Current Tetrapods! We are part of the <a href = "https://www.fc.unesp.br/#!/biologia">Department of Biological Sciences</a> at <a href = "https://www.bauru.unesp.br">São Paulo State University (Unesp)</a>, Bauru, Brazil. Our research focuses on gathering diverse lines of evidence to explore the <strong>evolutionary biology and systematics of tetrapods</strong>, with a special emphasis on <strong>amphibians</strong> and <strong>reptiles</strong>.

At LaBESTA, one of our core values is fostering a <strong>diverse</strong> and <strong>inclusive</strong> environment. We welcome individuals from all backgrounds to join us in our scientific endeavors. Our commitment to <strong>science communication</strong> is strong, with knowledge shared across multiple platforms, including the <a href="https://dragoesdegaragem.com">Dragões de Garagem</a> podcast, our lab’s social media, and through in-person outreach events. We also promote a <strong>collaborative atmosphere</strong>, encouraging members to pursue their own research projects while contributing to our shared mission of advancing evolutionary biology.


Get in touch or join our group! You'll find our contact details, including social media and email, at the bottom of the page. If you're passionate about <strong>phylogenetics</strong>, <strong>phylogeography</strong>, and <strong>biodiversity informatics</strong>, don't miss our <a href = "/blog">blog posts</a>, where we share valuable tips and insights on these topics.
