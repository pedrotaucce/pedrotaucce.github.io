Welcome to the Laboratory of Evolutionary Biology and Systematics of Current Tetrapods! We are part of the <a href = "https://www.fc.unesp.br/#!/biologia">Department of Biological Sciences</a> at <a href = "https://www.bauru.unesp.br">São Paulo State University (Unesp)</a>, Bauru, Brazil. Our research focuses on gathering diverse lines of evidence to explore the **evolutionary biology and systematics of tetrapods**, with a special emphasis on **amphibians** and **reptiles**.

Get in touch or join our group! You'll find our contact details, including social media and email, at the bottom of the page. If you're passionate about **phylogenetics**, **phylogeography**, and **biodiversity informatics**, don't miss our <a href = "/blog">blog posts</a>, where we share valuable tips and insights on these topics.
