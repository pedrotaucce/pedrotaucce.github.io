I am a broadly trained evolutionary zoologist, currently a Professor of Vertebrate Zoology at São Paulo State University (UNESP), Bauru, Brazil.

My research focuses on integrating disciplines such as bioacoustics, molecular phylogenetics, and morphology to explore the diversity and evolution of tetrapods, with a special emphasis on herpetofauna (amphibians and reptiles). I am particularly interested in the processes driving biodiversity, and more recently, the interplay between genotype and phenotype has become a central theme in my work.

Starting in the first semester of 2025, I will be teaching Vertebrate Zoology and Biogeography to undergraduate students. I am also passionate about science outreach and have been part of the [Dragões de Garagem](www.dragoesdegaragem.com.br) podcast team since 2020.
